## Project Description

This is a task management application for a to-do list. You can add tasks and click on them to mark them as completed. Additionally, you have the option to clear the entire list or only the items that have been marked as completed. Furthermore, you can rearrange tasks by moving them up or down. The application also allows you to save tasks in local storage, ensuring that the data persists when you reopen the page.
